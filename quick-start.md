# Variable Types

Your API requests are authenticated using API keys. Any request that doesn't include an API key will return an error.

You can generate an API key from your Dashboard at any time.

## What is Variable?

Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory.

Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.

Python has no command to declare a variable. A variable created the moment you assign a value to it

{% hint style="info" %}
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.

## What is Variable Types?

Types of data that Python able to store:

1. Number - [variable-number.md](variable-types/variable-number.md "mention")
2. String - [variable-string.md](variable-types/variable-string.md "mention")
3. List - [variable-list.md](variable-types/variable-list.md "mention")
4. Tuple - [variable-tuple.md](variable-types/variable-tuple.md "mention")
5. Dictionary - [variable-dictionary.md](variable-types/variable-dictionary.md "mention")
6. Set - [variable-set.md](variable-types/variable-set.md "mention")

{% hint style="warning" %}
Variable names are case-sensitive.
