# PYTHON 3

## Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ëMonty Pythonís Flying Circusí and not after Python-the snake.

## Why Python?

There are a few reasons why people choose Python over other languages.

* **Easy-to-learn** − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
* **Easy-to-read** − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
* **Easy-to-maintain** − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain. A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
* **Interactive Mode** − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
* **Portable** − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
* **Extendable** − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
* **Databases** − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
* **GUI Programming** − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
* **Scalable** − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
