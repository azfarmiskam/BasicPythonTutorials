# PYTHON 3

## Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ëMonty Pythonís Flying Circusí and not after Python-the snake.
